### Formulary properties

Some of the properties included on formularies at a `FormGroup` are:

+ `valid`, data received is valid.

+ `touched`, input received foucs.

+ `dirty`, input received a value, even if it was removed later.

+ `pristine`, input original value is the same as the actual one.

You may use this conditions to show or not error messages to improve the UX.
